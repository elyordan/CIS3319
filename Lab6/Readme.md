# Lab6: Implementation and Application of Kerberos

# Project Information
* Python 3
* Visual Studio Code
  
# How to run the Project
* Open three terminal windows
* Go inside the Lab 6 folder on all the terminal windows
* On one of the windows, run the server.py file with the command: python3 server.py
* On another of the windows, run the service.py file with the command: python3 service.py

Note: I had problems with python on my computer so instead of using the command python3, I had to use python3.9
